# Personal_Website
Code for my personal website

To visit it, just search Josiah McMenamy on google, or use this link: https://web.mit.edu/josiahmc/www/

This website is hosted with MIT, more info here: http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3907090 

While developing, here are terminal commands I frequently used:

SSH into Athena: ssh kerb@athena.dialup.mit.edu

Copy file from local to Athena: scp /Users/josiahmcmenamy/MIT_Website/filename kerb@athena.dialup.mit.edu:www/filename

In the future I would like to add a reCAPTCHA widget when users click on the email button. This would be a good opportunity to learn how that works.

I used cloud convert for converting pdf to svg. The svg was added to fix display issues when viewing on a mobile device.
